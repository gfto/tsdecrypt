tsdecrypt
=========
tsdecrypt reads incoming mpeg transport stream over UDP/RTP and then
decrypts it using using code words obtained from OSCAM or similar cam
server. tsdecrypt communicates with CAM server using cs378x (camd35
over tcp) protocol or newcamd protocol.

License
=======
tsdecrypt is released under GNU GPL v2.

Dependencies
============
tsdecrypt depends on openssl. It uses rand, MD5, DES and AES functions.
You probably already have openssl installed. If you are seeing compilation
errors related to missing openssl headers you should install openssl-dev
or similar packet depending on your Linux distribution.

If you are not using shipped FFdecsa then the other tsdecrypt dependency
is libdvbcsa. libdvbcsa can be downloaded from
http://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvbcsa.html

FFdecsa vs libdvbcsa
====================
tsdecrypt supports two different CSA decryption libraries.

libdvbcsa is an external library from VideoLAN project released under
LGPL, FFdecsa is shipped with tsdecrypt.

libdvbcsa
=========
libdvbcsa is better tested and have served tsdcrypt for a long time so
it is still the default decryption library. Also it is faster with file
input.

To compile tsdecrypt with libdvbcsa run 'make' or if you have tested
FFdecsa compilation and want to switch to libdvbcsa run 'make dvbcsa'.
'make distclean' switches decryption library back to libdvbcsa.

FFdecsa
=======
FFdecsa support was added after tsdecrypt v7.0. FFdecsa can be up to 40%
faster than libdvbcsa especially on 32-bit hardware. If you want to use
FFDecsa you have to run 'make ffdecsa'.

The setup script will test which FFDecsa algorithm is the fastest for
your CPU and will configure tsdecrypt compilation to stop using libdvbcsa.
Most likely the script will choose PARALLEL_128_SSE or PARALLEL_128_SSE2.
Once the script have finished it stores its decision in FFdecsa.opts file
and as long as this file exists tsdecrypt will be compiled with FFdecsa.
You can force regeneration by deleting running 'make ffdecsa_force' or
'make distclean ffdecsa'.

FFDecsa is considerably slower than libdvbcsa when tsdecrypt's input
is a file or stdin (single packet decryption mode). If you are
decrypting already recorded files you are better of using libdvbcsa.

When tsdecrypt is run it reports which decryption library is used in its
version string. You can use --bench option to test decryption speed.

Development
===========
The development is done using git. tsdecrypt repository is hosted
at http://github.com/gfto/tsdecrypt

To clone the repository issue the following commands:

   git clone git://github.com/gfto/tsdecrypt.git
   cd tsdecrypt
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   make

The code is developed and tested under modern Linux. It is also
compiled from time to time under OS X but is not tested there.

To see all Makefile targets run 'make help'.

Updating the code
=================
To update cloned tsdecrypt, go to the directory where the repository
is cloned and run the following commands:

   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/master
   git submodule update
   make clean all

tsdecrypt's master branch should always be useful so it is safe to
use it instead of official release. The master branch will always
be better than any released version.

Examples
========
To get a quick start here are some example command lines. The default
CA system is set to CONAX, you can change it using --ca-system parameter,
see man page or program help for more options.

Examples:

   # Decrypt multicast stream from 239.0.50.11:5000 using 10.0.1.1:2233
   # as camd server and output decrypted result to 239.78.78.78:5000
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but enable EMM processing
   tsdecrypt --emm --camd-server 10.0.1.1:2233 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Same as above but do not filter output stream thus allowing
   # EIT/TOT/NIT, etc tables to passthrough
   tsdecrypt --no-output-filter --emm --camd-server 10.0.1.1 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Choose program/service_id to decrypt. Useful when the input is MPTS
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 --input-service 1234 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Read stream over RTP and process VIACCESS encoded channel
   tsdecrypt --ca-system VIACCESS --emm --camd-server 10.0.1.1:2233 \
       --input-rtp --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Decrypt stream encypted with CAID 0x0963 (NDS, sky)
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 --ca-system NDS --caid 0x0963 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Send only EMMs to OSCAM for CAID 0x0963 (NDS, sky)
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 --emm-only --caid 0x0963 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output /dev/null

   # Decrypt stream encypted with CAID 0x5581 (Bulcrypt)
   tsdecrypt --camd-server 10.0.1.1 --caid 0x5581 \
       --input 239.0.50.11:5000 --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Decrypt BISS encrypted stream
   tsdecrypt --biss-key 0x112233445566 --input 239.0.50.11:5000 \
       --output 239.78.78.78:5000

   # Decrypt file encypted with constant code word
   tsdecrypt --const-cw 0x00000000000000001111111111111111 \
       --input encrypted-file.ts --output decrypted-file.ts


OSCAM cs378x configuration
==========================
In order for tsdecrypt to communicate with OSCAM using cs378x (camd35
over tcp) protocol you can use configuration like the examples bellow.

# Example oscam.user file:
[account]
user     = user
pwd      = pass
group    = 1
au       = 1
uniq     = 0
monlevel = 4

# Example part of oscam.conf file:
[cs378x]
port    = 2233

OSCAM newcamd configuration
===========================
In order for tsdecrypt to communicate with OSCAM using newcamd protocol
you can use configuration like the examples bellow.

# Example oscam.user file
[account]
user     = user
pwd      = pass
group    = 1
au       = 1
uniq     = 0
monlevel = 4
ident    = 0604:000000
caid     = 0604

# Example part of oscam.conf file:
[newcamd]
port     = 1122@0604:000000
serverip = 0.0.0.0
key      = 0102030405060708091011121314

The above example allows tsdecrypt clients using newcamd to retrive keys
from OSCAM serving CAID 0x0604 (Irdeto) on port 1122.

Reporting bugs
==============
If you think you have found bug in tsdecrypt, please report it to the
e-mail listed in Contact section (see below) of this README file.

Please use --debug 1 and --log-file tsdecrypt.log options and send the
resulting tsdecrypt.log file along with the full command line which you
used and describe what you think the tsdecrypt does wrong.

One commonly seen error is not an error in tsdecrypt at all. You
have to make sure that the software that streams channels from the
DVB card is sending ECMs and EMMs along with other streams. If these
streams are missing you'll probably get the following messages from
tsdecrypt:

2012-04-02 22:02:12 | ECM | Received 0 (0 dup) and processed 0 in 3 seconds.
2012-04-02 22:03:09 | CW  | *ERR* No valid code word was received for 60 seconds!
2012-04-02 22:03:12 | ECM | Received 0 (0 dup) and processed 0 in 60 seconds.

Please configure your software to stream ECMs and EMMs. For dvblast
(version 2.0 and above) the correct options are --ecm-passthrough and
--emm-passthrough. Note that dvblast 2.1 have broken ecm passthrough
so use at least version 2.2.
