xxxx-xx-xx : Version -next
 * Add new notification message STREAM_NOT_ENCRYPTED. When stream is not
   encrypted no NO_CODE_WORD notifications are sent.
 * Add --notify-wait (-9) option (not set by default). Using it prevents
   running of several notification scripts in parallel which can lead to
   races if the scripts are used for logging.
 * Start passing _INPUT_ADDR and _OUTPUT_ADDR variables to notify script.

2013-09-12 : Version 10.0
 * Add --ecm-only (-v) option. This allows processing of ECMs but without
   decoding the input stream.
 * Add --ecm-and-emm-only (-q) option. This allows processing of ECMs
   and EMMs but without decoding the input stream.
 * Set newcamd client id to 0x7878 (tsdecrypt).
 * Fixed regression that apeared in 9.0 which prevented the output from
   working if the output address was not multicast.
 * Add support for Griffin CAS and for DGCrypt CAS.
 * Add support for setting multicast source address /SSM/ (--input-source).
 * Add support for EMM filters similar to DVBAPI filters (match + mask).
 * Add support for EMM filters based on section length.
 * Add support for Irdeto CHID filtering (tested with Raduga).

2012-09-10 : Version 9.0
 * Add --no-output-on-error (-u) option. By using this option output can be
   disabled if there is no currently received code word.
 * Remove deprecated --output-filter option. The option you should use is
  --no-output-filter.
 * Allow camd server address (--camd-server, -s) to be resolved, not only
   set by IP address.
 * Allow tsdecrypt to read ECM/EMM packet from text file. The added
   parameters are -n, -ecm-file <file> and -m --emm-file <file>.
 * Add support for CAMD server listening on IPv6.
 * Add support for input and output over IPv6.
 * Add support for forcing only IPv4 (-4, --ipv4) or only IPv6 (-6, --ipv6).
 * Add support for multiple CAMD addresses returned when resolving CAMD
   server hostname. tsdecrypt would try each of the addresses and use
   the one that works.
 * Change the way filenames are set in input/output options.
   Now file:// prefix is must be added before the filename otherwise
   the parameter is treated as network address.
 * Add --emm-filter (-a) option. This option implements EMM filtering.

2012-04-19 : Version 8.1
 * Add support for Bulcrypt CAS.

2012-04-12 : Version 8.0
 * Add --biss-key (-Q) option. This option enables BISS decryption.
 * Add FFdecsa support. In most cases FFdecsa decrypts faster than libdvcsa.
   To compile with FFdecsa support use "make ffdecsa".
 * Add --const-cw (-Y) option. This option allows using of constant
   code words for decryption.
 * Add "make help" target.
 * Display better timing information for ECMs and code word changes.
 * Filter special symbols in provider and service names before printing them.

2012-03-07 : Version 7.0
 * Add --input-buffer (-T) option. This option allows uninterrupted
   decryption even if OSCAM returns code words too late.
 * Add --log-file (-F) option.
 * Fixed newcamd protocol issues when OSCAM disappeared.
 * Fix (and optimize) decryption when the input is MPTS. Previously
   decrypting one stream broke the others.
 * notify: Add NO_EMM_RECEIVED event.

2012-02-24 : Version 6.0
 * Add --output-tos (-g) option used to set output TOS value.
 * Add --input-dump (-W) option used save input stream in file.
 * Add --pid-report (-j) option used to turn on PID reporting.
 * Add RTP output enabled by --output-rtp (-r) option.
 * Add --output-rtp-ssrc (-k) option used to set RTP SSRC.
 * A bug was fixed that prevented tsdecrypt from working if CAMD server
   was not available for couple of minutes.

2011-12-23 : Version 5.0
 * Add --bench (-b) option that benchmarks libdvbcsa decryption.
 * Remove --camd-pkt-delay (-y) option. This workaround is no longer needed.
 * Fix payload offset detection, a bug which broke packets that have
   adaptation with whole packet size (libtsfuncs).
 * Add --input-service (-M) option, to choose service id (program) in MPTS input.
 * When the input is MPTS and output filtering is enabled, rewrite output
   PAT to include only the single program that is decoded.
 * Parse SDT and display provider and service name.
 * Add --output-nit-pass (-y) to enable NIT pass through.
 * Add --output-eit-pass (-w) to enable EIT (EPG) pass through.
 * Add --output-tdt-pass (-x) to enable TDT/TOT pass through.
 * Add support for newcamd CAMD protocol.
 * Add ECM/EMM queues depth limit to avoid allocating too much memory.

2011-11-18 : Version 4.0
 * Set CAMD sockets NODELAY to avoid OSCAM errors when many packets are sent.
 * Add --syslog parameter to enable local syslog logging.
 * Set thread names under Linux.
 * notify: Added no_code_word/code_word_ok events.
 * notify: Added input_timeout/input_ok events.
 * notify: Added start/stop events.
 * notify: Added option to execute external script on event.

2011-11-14 : Version 3.2
 * Fixed bug that prevented tsdecrypt from working at all :(

2011-11-12 : Version 3.1
 * Add debug level 5 (full mpeg ts packet dump).
 * Fix PSI table gathering in invalid transport streams.
 * Fix EMM/ECM parsing (this fixes ORF1 decoding on Astra 19.2).
 * Process ECMs before EMMs, preventing the case where too much
   incoming EMMs interfere with decryption.

2011-09-30 : Version 3.0
 * Add man page.
 * Add support for long command line options.
 * Add make install/uninstall Makefile targets.
 * Add support for compilation on OS X.
 * Add tested support for Viaccess.
 * Add tested support for Mediaguard (Seca).
 * Add tested support for Videoguard (NDS).
 * Add untested support for Nagra.
 * Add untested support for DRE-Crypt.
 * Add option to disable ECM and CW logging (--ecm-no-log).
 * Add option to manually set EMM pid (--emm-pid).
 * Add option to manually set ECM pid (--ecm-pid).
 * Add option to manually set CAID (--caid).
 * Add ECM reports (--ecm-report-time).
 * Log warnings when there is no input data.
 * Log warnings when code word become invalid.

2011-09-15 : Version 2.0
 * Initial public release.
